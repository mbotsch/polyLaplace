The Polygon Mesh Processing Library is a modern C++ open-source library for
processing and visualizing polygon surface meshes. Its core features are:

- An efficient and easy-to-use mesh data structure
- Canonical mesh processing algorithms
- Ready-to-use visualization tools

![Demo](docs/images/demo.gif)

See [www.pmp-library.org](http://www.pmp-library.org) for more information.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/pmp-library/pmp-library.git
```

Configure and build:

```sh
cd pmp-library && mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make
```

Run the mesh processing app:

```sh
./mpview ../external/pmp-data/off/bunny.off
```

## Usage

```cpp
#include <pmp/SurfaceMesh.h>

int main(void)
{
    pmp::SurfaceMesh mesh;
    mesh.read("input.obj");
    // .. do something with your mesh
    mesh.write("output.obj");
}
```
