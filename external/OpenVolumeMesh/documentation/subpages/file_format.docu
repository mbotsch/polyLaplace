\page file_format File Format

%OpenVolumeMesh comes with a file format specification
that is implemented in the OpenVolumeMesh::IO::FileManager class.
As for now, the file format only supports plain text, but a support
for binary files is planned. Also the serialization of the
persistent properties is not implemented, yet.
A full generic support is planned for the future.
%OpenVolumeMesh files should have the file name extension *.ovm.
Find the file format specification below.
