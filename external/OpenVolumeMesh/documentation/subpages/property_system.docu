In %OpenVolumeMesh it is possible to attach properties of any data type to
each of the entity types. This is accomplished by using template programming concepts
of C++. All properties are instances of the class OpenVolumeMesh::OpenVolumeMeshPropertyT
that expects a data type as template parameter. See Section \ref generic_properties for a
more detailed overview about how to use properties. Tutorial \ref ovm_tutorial_03
additionally describes how to use properties in practice using a compilable example.
