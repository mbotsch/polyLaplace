# Interactive HTML Slides {#interactive-html-slides-2019-06-02}

One of the nifty features of the pmp-library is cross-compilation to JavaScript,
thereby allowing to run mesh processing applications directly in a
WebGL2-compatible browser. This feature also allows to seamlessly include demo
applications into HTML lecture slides, allowing students to interactively
explore geometry processing algorithms. We just published a set of example
slides demonstrating this application case:

Stay tuned for details on how to build your own interactive slides, there's more
to come.
